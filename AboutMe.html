<h2>I'm Josefine Older Steffensen.</h2>
<p> I am a 21 year old Danish girl, with a serious passion for food. I'm currently living in Bristol, where I study Geography. I really love cooking, and tend to make things that are quite easy to make, and don't have a list of 34 ingredients. I try to share my recipes as often as I can - but can at times get a little busy. I hope you enjoy my page, and if you have any questions, then go to the Contact tab! XXX
